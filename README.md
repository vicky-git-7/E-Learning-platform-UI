DESCRIPTION

The project involves the design of an interactive e-learning platform's front-end, incorporating features such as course listings, progress tracking, and video embedding. The platform would feature a home page to emphasize featured courses, a course catalog with search and filters, a course details page with embedded videos, and a user dashboard that tracks progress and achievements. Using HTML for structure, CSS for presentation, and JavaScript for interactivity, it will always be responsive to operate across different devices and have a user-friendly interface. The result is an interactive, multi-page visually appealing and user-friendly environment that enhances learning among users.
